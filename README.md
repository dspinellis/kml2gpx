kml2gpx
=======
Converts KML generated by Movescount to Strava-compatible GPX. Movescount does not include 
power data in it's GPX export; Strava doesn't import KML files.

Usage
=====
./kml2gpx &lt;input&gt; &lt;output&gt;

Dependencies
============
xmllint (`brew install xmllib2`)
xmlstarlet (`brew install xmlstarlet`)

Limitations
===========
- Assumes that the input file has only a single Track
- Only pulls out the basic data needed by Strava
